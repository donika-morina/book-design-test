## Book Design Test Area

This is a separate space for me to test new designs for The Media Journal ([https://donikasnotebook.com/](https://donikasnotebook.com/media-journal)). Pure HTML and CSS. Mostly hacked together. May need revision and simplification in the future.

## Current Designs:

#### Books Stationary:
